Hello and welcome to the Star Wars Guide!

Needed packages for this script: http.server, requests, json.

To get started, please download the folder and run the star_wars.py file from your console.
If wanted, one can go into the script and set the get_full_jsons variable (under User Controls at the top) to = True if the full json is desired to be seen. Otherwise, you may click around the different subjects.
